- Cross-platform compatibility including smartwatches and Alexa

*4. Bublup*
- Visual organization system with "rolls" for different project types

- Unified interface replacing multiple productivity tools


### App Concept: Reverb
 - A context-aware audio journal that transforms voice memos into organized insights using AI analysis. The app would automatically:
1. Emotional Tone Tagging - Classify entries using vocal biomarkers (pitch, speed, intensity) to surface emotional patterns over time
2. Concept Mapping - Create visual networks linking related topics/people mentioned across recordings
2. Auto-Highlights - Generate condensed audio clips of key moments using semantic analysis

 - Unique implementation would include:
1. Spatial Audio Playback - Re-experience memories with environment-aware sound positioning
2. Cross-Reference Alerts - Notify when current conversation topics match past entries
3. Voice-Driven Search - "Find times I discussed creative blocks before breakthroughs"
4. This addresses the gap between raw voice recordings and actionable self-knowledge, using audio processing advancements beyond standard transcription apps.

 - The core value proposition is transforming spoken reflections into a navigable knowledge graph rather than linear archives.
